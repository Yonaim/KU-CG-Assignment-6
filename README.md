# Overview

This project is a simple rasterizer written in C++, without relying on any high-level graphics APIs.

OpenGL is used solely for creating the window and displaying the final framebuffer â€” all rendering computations are performed on the CPU.

While the project uses the GLM library for basic math operations, such as vectors and matrices, all graphics-specific transformations (e.g., projection, viewport, rotation) are implemented manually from scratch, without using GLM's built-in graphics utilities.

All objects in the scene are represented as triangle meshes, which are transformed and rasterized through a custom CPU-based pipeline.
